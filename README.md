# Inventory Manager

This Project is what I created for a restaurant owned by my parents. Instead of using inventory management app, this one is neat and easy to use. 
It contains several different functions that are good enough for a small chain of restaurants. 
I recommend reading through the code and set up databases accordingly, will add instructions and a tester/template file in later commits to help with this.
